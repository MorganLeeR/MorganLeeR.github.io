					<p>Earlier this morning, a local of Boston, Hester Prynne, was publicly shamed upon her release from prison.</p>					<img src="8614468600_d7da07a4e1_o.jpg" align="right" alt="Hester" height="200" width="185" style="padding-left: 15px">
					<p>Hester was convicted of adultery nearly one year ago when she was found to be pregnant even though her husband, Roger Chillingworth, was nowhere to be seen. She fortunately avoided execution because the other man hasn't been found either. Currently, Hester lives with her daughter Pearl whom she gave birth to in prison. Boston is a puritan society, and it is no surprise that people have mixed views on the situation. One says, "I don't think Hester should have received the death penalty. Even though adultery is a heinous sin, her husband left for a long time. And who would take care of Pearl?"
					Another remarked, "I think she should have been severely punished for her crimes against our society! If she didn't break her vows, then there wouldn't be a child for her to have to take care of." The last interviewee said, "At first, public shaming didn't seem like a proper punishment, but knowing that she has to live with the guilt and shame along with the scarlet letter for the rest of her life seems sufficient." The case will be investigated further, but for now, Hester will live peacefully with her daughter.</p>
